        <em>by Herman de Coninck</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.
        <br />
        And in spring too I feel no diffrent.
        <br />
        We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
        <br />
        through much dark-red loss,
        <em>
          appellation controlee,
          <br />
          <br />
        </em>
        that deepens in the cellar of the years.
        <br />
        We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.
        <br />
        Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees
        <br />
        sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.
        <br />
        <br />
        33, and in the midst of the dark wood
        <br />
        of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,
        <br />
        at home in the woods and desolate at home.
        <br />
        <br />
        Will we one day, maybe, ever?
        <br />
        The summer is past, the hay-making is over.
        <br />
        the here is nowhere, and the now is never.
        <br />
        <br />
